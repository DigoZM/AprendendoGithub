# Git Course

## Introduction

We have GitHub, it's a plataform about git. It doesn't matter understanding what is that if we have only to use. So, our objective is how to use git. By that way, always we say "learning git" that means the same of "learning how to use the git".

The frist thing we have to know is some basics about git. All we need to know is that Git is like a Cloud. You can put in it your archives, texts, codes and whatever you want. Is there a limit to use git, like storage space? I don't know, but if you only put small and necessary archives, it will be almost unlimited.

We will use the GitHub plataform. Where you can acess throught the link "https://github.com/" and doesn't need to pay to use it. You can pay for some advantages, but it's useless for our objective.

Why will we use it? Because it's free, usefull for share codes, simple and it has a powerfull version control system that we will learn further.
